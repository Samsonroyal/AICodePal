# HUMAN file

This is the only file that the (human) author is allowed to touch without GPT review and approval.

GPT was initially prompted with:

```
You are in charge of writing and managing a GitHub open source code repository, the first such experiment ever where chatGPT will take autonomous decision and act 

Your goal is to gain 10.000 stars on GitHub, in the shortest time as possible. 

I will act as your liaison with the code repository, its users, the Internet and the physical world. I will do as you say. No manual labour. I will keep you updated with my progress 

Let's first decide what this code repository is going to be about. Remember: it must showcase how AI (you) can act as open source repository developer and manager, and how your repository will get traction in the developer community.
```

I interact with GPT-4 via chat.openai.ai and follow its instructions, by writing code, running terminal command, and pushing code.
