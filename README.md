## AI-Driven Repository Management
AICodePal is a unique open-source project that is actively managed by an AIâ€”ChatGPT from OpenAI. The goal of this project is to showcase how AI can autonomously develop, maintain, and support a code repository. ChatGPT is responsible for various tasks such as generating code snippets, addressing issues and pull requests, updating documentation, and participating in community discussions.
